let acknowledgementText = "Many thanks to the following individuals who helped me get this far with Shugga:\n\nGlo Glo the Nurse\n\nLocalizations:\n\n   Deutsch: My better half Ms. Fritz\n   Italiano: Tiziana\n   ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥: Alex Y.\n   Fran√ßais: Haruka\n\nMoral Support: \n\n   HenriüöÄ, everyone's secret weapon!!\n   Justineüö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, a vet who actually cares!!\n   Stephenüê§, the only benevolent ÂÆáÂÆô‰∫∫ I know!!\n\nMoral Hazard & LLC: Gregman G.\n\nAs for my own Type 1 diabetes, I want to express my gratitude to all of you who have supported me over the past 20 odd years. This includes the fantastic doctors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) & nurses and all the tech support and accounting teams at CGM/Pump manufacturers. Also I cannot forget those of you who created and support Loop.app and LoopKit. ÀÆThank you all for saving my life.ÀÆ\n\nHmmm, I'm unsure whether I should express gratitude towards my insurance company. To cover my annual premium, I would need tens of thousands of downloads per year. It's astonishing to think that we consider this practice acceptable in a supposedly first-world nation.\n\nTo everyone else, THANK YOU SO MUCH for downloading and purchasing. Living with diabetes can be immensely challenging, and it may be difficult for others to truly understand. However, I hope this small app will bring some manageability and enjoyment to your life.‚ù§Ô∏è"
