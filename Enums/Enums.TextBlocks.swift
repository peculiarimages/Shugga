"While this app is a project of a single mere mortal behind the veil of an LLC, many thanks to the following individuals who helped me get this far with Shugga:

Moral Hazard & LLC: Gregman G.

As for my own pancreas that stoped behaving 20 odd years ago: I would like to express my profound gratitude to everyone who has supported me over the past, despite of your bad attitude.

This includes all the outstanding doctors, nurses and other clinicians, as well as the pharmacists who go the extra mile to provide me with those hard-to-find 3 ml Humalog vials!

I also need to thank all the researchers on this illness, developers of medical devices and the technical support and accounting teams at CGM/Pump manufacturers. Moreover, I can't forget to express my gratitude to those who created and support Loop.app and LoopKit. 'Thank you all for saving my life.'

While I'm hesitant to thank my insurance company, it's worth noting that if others knew the cost of my monthly premium, they might üí© in your üëñ. It's astonishing that we tolerate such \"culture\" in a nation that considers itself advanced.

To everyone else, THANK YOU SO MUCH for downloading. Living with diabetes can be immensely challenging, and it might be difficult for others to fully comprehend this struggle. However, I hope this small app will bring some degree of manageability and joy to your life. The only one we've got.

This is why I decided to make ShuggaShugga:

Two summers earlier, I had capsized three times in a single day due to an unexpected storm during solo kayak fishing on Bodega Bay, CA. My trusted NOAA's Maine-Point-Forecast hadn't predicted this. A slew of boaters, also rushing back to safety, blew past me in the water, waving to them after I announced on the marine radio that I'm thinking about ringing the Coast Guard... I was about to turn my radio channel from 69 to 16 (Coast Guard) when one boat rescued me (Thank you! Your comments about sharks were \"hilarious!\").

It took me a while to regain my confidence and return to the water, but by the following summer, I was fishing again as often as I could, albeit with a lot more caution.
"""

let whyShugga_2 = """
On an otherwise pleasant summer day kayaking again, I noticed the wind picking up and the water becoming choppier (not again!). A quick glance at the fish-finder's GPS indicated that I was about 45 minutes from the safety of Dillon Beach if I were to paddle hard continuously (my kayak is of the leg-powered, pedal-driven type, about 4-5 knots max. My VO2Max is that of an Average-Joe's).

As the sea grew rougher, with my left hand maneuvering the rudder and my right maintaining balance, I had no spare moments to check my blood sugar.I didn't want to pour carbs unnecessarily (Nerds are my go-to). My Apple Watch was virtually useless due to my wet hands, and my waterlogged iPhone, tethered to my lifejacket, was similarly unresponsive (not broken). To optimally navigate back to the shore, a continuous auditory cue of my BG would have been immensely helpful. Hence, this app.

ShuggaShugga is a simple yet highly customizable iPhone app that announces your latest blood glucose (BG) data found in your HealthKit. Primarily built as a companion for Loop.app, it also serves those who have their live BG values written to HealthKit by other means. It also caters to those who manually enter their BG values into Health app, though in a limited capacity. This particular version is offered at no charge for Loop users only.

Additionally, it provides an optional display of your carb intake in the past 24 hrs. (also sourced from Health data)

The app's design and customization cater to a wide range of users, offering enhanced accessibility for visually impaired individuals and features for active users. The main page is deliberately kept simple for quick visual cues.

ShuggaShugga is exclusively compatible with iPhones due to its dependence on Apple Health, which is not available on other devices (iPads, etc).
